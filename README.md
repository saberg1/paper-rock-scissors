## Overview

Rock/Paper/Scissors is a game that lets you put it all on the line! Rock/Paper/Scissors is how I made my first million at the high roller tables in Vegas. But if you're feeling really lucky, theres a MORTALLLLL KOMBATTT setting that'll really test your skills of probability. The players increase to five, but they can beat two oppoonents.
